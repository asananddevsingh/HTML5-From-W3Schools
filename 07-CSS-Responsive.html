    <b>What is Responsive Web Design?</b> Responsive web design makes your web page look good on all devices. Responsive web design uses only HTML and CSS. Responsive web design is not a program or a JavaScript.

    <b>Responsive Web Design - The Viewport</b>
    <p>What is The Viewport?</p>
    The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. The viewport varies with the device, and will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen. Before tablets and mobile phones, web pages were designed only for computer screens, and it was common for web pages to have a static design and a fixed size. Then, when we started surfing the internet using tablets and mobile phones, fixed size web pages were too large to fit the viewport. To fix this, browsers on those devices scaled down the entire web page to fit the screen. This was not perfect, but a quick fix.
    <br> <b>Setting The Viewport</b>
    <br>HTML5 introduced a method to let web designers take control over the viewport, through the &lt;meta> tag. You should include the following &lt;meta> viewport element in all your web pages:


    <br>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <br> A &lt;meta> viewport element gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling. The <b>width=device-width</b> part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device). The <b>initial-scale=1.0</b> part sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded by the browser. Here is an example of a web page without the viewport meta tag, and the same web page with the viewport meta tag:
    <h2>Size Content to The Viewport</h2> Users are used to scroll websites vertically on both desktop and mobile devices - but not horizontally! So, if the user is forced to scroll horizontally, or zoom out, to see the whole web page it results in a poor user experience. Some additional rules to follow:
    <p><strong>1. Do NOT use large fixed width elements - </strong>For example, if an image is displayed at a width wider than the viewport it can cause the viewport to scroll horizontally. Remember to adjust this content to fit within the width of the viewport.</p>
    <p><strong>2. Do NOT let the content rely on a particular viewport width to
render well</strong> - Since screen dimensions and width in CSS pixels vary widely between devices, content should not rely on a particular viewport width to render well.</p>
    <p><strong>3. Use CSS media queries to apply different styling for small and
large screens</strong> - Setting large absolute CSS widths for page elements, will cause the element to be too wide for the viewport on a smaller device. Instead, consider using relative width values, such as width: 100%. Also, be careful of using large absolute positioning values. It may cause the element to fall outside the viewport on small devices.</p>

    <h2>Responsive Web Design - Grid-View</h2> <b>What is a Grid-View?</b> Many web pages are based on a grid-view, which means that the page is divided into columns:

    <br>Using a grid-view is very helpful when designing web pages. It makes it easier to place elements on the page. A responsive grid-view often has 12 columns, and has a total width of 100%, and will shrink and expand as you resize the browser window.
    <br>
    <b>Building a Responsive Grid-View</b>
    <br> Lets start building a responsive grid-view. First ensure that all HTML elements have the box-sizing property set to border-box. This makes sure that the padding and border are included in the total width and height of the elements. Add the following code in your CSS:
    <br>
    <u>* {
    box-sizing: border-box;
} </u>
    <br>

    <h2>What is a Media Query?</h2> Media query is a CSS technique introduced in CSS3. It uses the @media rule to include a block of CSS properties only if a certain condition is true.
    <br>
    <b>Add a Breakpoint</b>
    <br> Earlier in this tutorial we made a web page with rows and columns, and it was responsive, but it did not look good on a small screen. Media queries can help with that. We can add a breakpoint where certain parts of the design will behave differently on each side of the breakpoint.
    <br>Use a media query to add a breakpoint at 768px:
    <hr>
    <b>Always Design for Mobile First</b>
    <br>Mobile First means designing for mobile before designing for desktop or any other device (This will make the page display faster on smaller devices). This means that we must make some changes in our CSS. Instead of changing styles when the width gets smaller than 768px, we should change the design when the width gets larger than 768px. This will make our design Mobile First:
    <br> <b>Another Breakpoint</b> You can add as many breakpoints as you like. We will also insert a breakpoint between tablets and mobile phones.
    <br> We do this by adding one more media query (at 600px), and a set of new classes for devices larger than 600px (but smaller than 768px):

    <b>Responsive Web Design - Images</b>
    <br><b>Using The width Property</b> If the width property is set to 100%, the image will be responsive and scale up and down:

    <br><u>Example
img {
    width: 100%;
    height: auto;
}</u>
    <br>
    <b>Using The max-width Property</b>
    <br> If the max-width property is set to 100%, the image will scale down if it has to, but never scale up to be larger than its original size:
    <br>
    <u>Example
img {
    max-width: 100%;
    height: auto;
}</u>
    <br>
    <b>Background Images</b>
    <br> Background images can also respond to resizing and scaling. Here we will show three different methods:
    <p>1. If the <code>background-size</code> property is set to "contain", the background image will scale, and try to fit the content area. However, the image will keep its aspect ratio (the proportional relationship between the image's width and height):</p>
    <p>2. If the <code>background-size</code> property is set to "100% 100%", the background image will stretch to cover the entire content area:</p>
    <p>3. If the <code>background-size</code> property is set to "cover", the background image will scale to cover the entire content area. Notice that the "cover" value keeps the aspect ratio, and some part of the background image may be clipped:
    </p>
    <br> You can use the media query min-device-width, instead of min-width, which checks the device width, instead of the browser width. Then the image will not change when you resize the browser window:

    <br><u>Example
/* For devices smaller than 400px: */
body {
    background-image: url('img_smallflower.jpg');
}

/* For devices 400px and larger: */
@media only screen and (<b>min-device-width: 400px</b>) {
    body {
        background-image: url('img_flowers.jpg');
    }
}</u>
</body>
